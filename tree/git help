Adding a remote
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
For example:

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

git remote -v
# Verify new remote
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
Not sure which URL to use? Check out "Which remote URL should I use?."

Troubleshooting

You may encounter these errors when trying to add a remote.

Remote name already exists

This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists in your local repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife
# fatal: remote origin already exists.
To fix this, you can

Use a different name for the new remote
Rename the existing remote
Delete the existing remote
